# 🚀 Full Stack Web3 Development Crash Course by Cyfrin Updraft

## About This Repository

Welcome to my public learning journal! This repository serves as a **daily progress tracker** where I document my journey through the Cyfrin Updraft Full Stack Web3 Development Crash Course.

The primary use for this is to serve as motivation for my own progress

### So here we will:

- **📝 Daily commits** with new code, notes, and new learnings
- **💡 Code examples** and projects built during the course
- **📚 Knowledge repository** for future reference and consultation

As the time goes by, I will keep updating this everyday NONSTOP!

- Created a simple "Connect" button to test blockchain wallet connections
- Since I use WSL, I had to go beyond simply opening the index.html file and learned to run a server inside my project folder - something I didn't know was possible before
- Using WSL is significantly increasing my capabilities for software testing within my applications
- Learned how to connect MetaMask (or pretty much any EVM wallet) to my own website
